          //- Replace the boilerplate below with your best elevator pitch
          p  There is always a way to improve the way we use technology. I have always had a desire to be an inventor of sorts. Applications like GoPuff, and UberEats, were ideas that I've wanted to create. Applications like these help to change our life experiences. Technology is continuously changing our lives, and I desire to be a part of this change. With my ability to problem-solve and think outside of the box, any team I join will be as eager to impact the world.
